# Llama-2-Soccer-Chatbot

## Overview
🔍 Using Python and LangChain, with the powerful Chainlit framework, I developed a system to extract insights from merged PDFs dataset ⚽️.
I harnessed Hugging Face's powerful embeddings and FAISS vector stores to process and index over 1000 pages of soccer content, from historical texts to coaching manuals.

## The core of the project involved:

- 📖 Extracting and chunking PDF content with DirectoryLoader and PyPDFLoader.
- 🧩 Splitting text into chunks with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
- 🤖 Employing Hugging Face Embeddings (MiniLM-L6-v2) for text representation.

- 📚 Developing a precise Retrieval QA Chain using LangChain's RetrievalQA, which integrated the powerful Llama2 model by Meta
- 🌐 The retrieval system I built enables precise information retrieval, delivering accurate responses based on user queries.
